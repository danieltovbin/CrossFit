# CrossFitPulsePro
I am a fan of coding and CrossFit, so I decided to create a CrossFit website. I took inspiration from a few different random CrossFit sites and made my own website.
Originally built with JavaScript, this project has been converted to TypeScript for improved type safety and development experience.

## Features
- **Homepage**: Learn about what CrossFit is and what it can do for you.
- **Demo Video**: A short video demonstrating CrossFit.
- **Contact Us**: At the bottom of the homepage, you can send a message.
- **Navigation**: The header includes navigation links. Both "GETTING STARTED" and "CONTACT US" are on the homepage, while "Shop" is on a separate page.
- **Shop Page**: View CrossFit products, add items to the cart, and see the products you added via the cart icon placed in the header. You can also remove items from the cart by clicking the remove button.
- **404 Page**: Displayed when trying to access a non-existent page.

## Tools and Technologies
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language for the web.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **SCSS**: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets for enhanced styling.
- **BEM**: Block Element Modifier methodology for naming CSS classes.
- **Context**: React Context API for managing state.
